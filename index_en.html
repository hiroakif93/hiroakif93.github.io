                I am Hiroaki Fujita Ph.D of Science (Kyoto, Japan, 2023),<br>
                working with Assistant professor of CeLiSIS in Kyoto Univ.<br>
                I was a Data Scientist at IQVIA Solutions Japan after that JSPS Research Fellow (DC1) at the Science department of Kyoto University (Japan).

            <h3>My Reseach</h3>
            <ul>
                I am currently working on 3 research topics: <br>prediction of microbiome stability, analysis function of fish gut microbiome and interaction in aquatic microbial community.<br>
                In the future, I'd like to conduct research to elucidate the ecological role of Myxomycetes.
